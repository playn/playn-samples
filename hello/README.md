# PlayN Hello World

This sample program just displays a background image and listens for clicks/touches and sticks a
rotating image at the place where the click/touch happened. It mainly serves as a minmal example of
all the scaffolding needed to make a game run on all the different platforms, and it can be a good
project to hack on when you want to try some simple code snippet.

## Building and running

Using [Maven], do:

```
cd playn-samples/hello
mvn test -Pbugsim

```

```
cd playn-samples/hello
mvn install -Pbugdev

```

For setting up in an IDE or building for Android, iOS and HTML, see the [development environment]
documentation on the PlayN website.
